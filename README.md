**ClavionHub** was originally developed as a console-based Learning Management System (LMS) for the Junior Java Developer course at Brain Academy. The application is now being rewritten as a modern web application using Spring Boot and related technologies. The project demonstrates layered architecture, database work via JPA, Thymeleaf templates, and Spring Security.

> ⚠️ The project is under active development. Many features are not yet implemented or are still in progress.
