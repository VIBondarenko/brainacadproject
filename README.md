📘 **BrainAcad Project** is a console-based **Learning Management System (LMS)** application, developed as part of the **Junior Java Developer** course at Brain Academy (2015–2016). The project demonstrates key principles of object-oriented programming, working with collections, data serialization, and Java application architecture.

## 🎓 Implemented Features

- 📚 **Course Management** — create, edit, and delete courses.
- 👨‍🎓 **Student Management** — register students and view student information.
- 🧑‍🏫 **Teacher Management** — create teacher profiles and assign them to courses.
- 📝 **Course Enrollment** — students can enroll in available courses.
- 📄 **Reporting** — display information about courses, students, and teachers.
- 💾 **Data Persistence** — objects are serialized to a `Storage.ser` file and can be restored on application restart.

## 🛠️ Technologies

- Java SE 8+
