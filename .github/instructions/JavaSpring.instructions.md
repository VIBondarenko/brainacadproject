Provide project context and coding guidelines that AI should follow when generating code, answering questions, or reviewing changes.

1. **Project Structure**: Understand the overall structure of the project, including key packages and their responsibilities (e.g., controllers, services, repositories).

2. **Coding Standards**: Follow established coding standards and best practices for Java and Spring development, including naming conventions, code organization, and documentation.

3. **Logging**: Use the appropriate logging levels (e.g., `info`, `warn`, `error`) consistently throughout the codebase. Prefer parameterized logging (e.g., `logger.info("Message {}", variable)`) over string concatenation.

4. **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling strategies, including the use of exceptions and meaningful error messages.

5. **Testing**: Write unit tests for all new features and ensure existing tests are not broken. Follow the project's testing conventions and use appropriate testing frameworks (e.g., JUnit, Mockito).

6. **Code Reviews**: Participate in code reviews, providing constructive feedback and being open to suggestions for improvement.

7. **Documentation**: Update documentation (e.g., API docs, README files) to reflect any changes made to the codebase.

8. **Continuous Integration**: Ensure that all changes pass automated tests and adhere to the project's CI/CD pipeline requirements.

By following these guidelines, you can help maintain a high-quality codebase that is easy to understand, maintain, and extend.
